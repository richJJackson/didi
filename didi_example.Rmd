## Intro

This gives a basic example of how to use the 'Didi' estimator to visualise the impact of continuous covariates on time-to-event outcomes

## Simulated data
Three covariates are required which are simulated for N=100 observations
* Time variable: using rexp(N,0.05)
* Censoring Indicator: using rbinom(N,1,0.1)
* Covariate: using rnorm(N)

```{r dataSim}
  N <- 100
  st <- rexp(N,0.05)
  cen <- rbinom(N,1,0.1)
  x <- rnorm(N)
```

## Calculate the double weighted kernel (Didi) estimator


```{r didiPlot, echo=FALSE}
  didi <- didiEst(st,cen,x)
```
